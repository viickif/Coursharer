# Coursharer

> Inspiration: to create a platform for instructors to share their whole file every frame instead of just their screen. This will allow students to see what the instructor talked about in the previous screen simply by scrolling rather than rewinding the video and the fast forwarding it to its original position

#### Run

```terminal

```

### Installation

Install `Python3` and `Pip3`

```Linux
pip3 install flask
pip3 install flask_bootstrap
pip3 install flask_wtf
pip3 install flask_sqlalchemy
pip3 install  flask_login
```

If you are using VSCode, complete the following to avoid Flask-SQLAlchemy Pylint errors:

1. Run `pip install pylint-flask` in terminal
2. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P`. Then enter “Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)”
3. Add "python.linting.pylintArgs": ["--load-plugins", "pylint_flask"]
